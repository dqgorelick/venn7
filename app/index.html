                <h1>Venn 7 - Exploring Symmetric 7-Venn Diagrams with a Musical Interface</h1>

                <p>You may be familiar with the following Venn diagrams, which visualize all possible intersections of two and three sets:</p>

                <p>To introduce some clear terminology, the boundary of each set is referred to as a "curve," and the shapes formed by interesctions and differences of curves are the "regions." The 2-Venn diagram has three regions and the 3-Venn diagram seven regions. In general, an <em>n</em>-Venn diagram has exactly 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> - 1 regions. Finally, we'll define the "order" of a region as the number of curves it is contained in.</p>

                <p>What about a 4-Venn diagram? Our first attempt might look like this:</p>

                [image]

                <p>On closer inspection, this diagram is incorrect. There are only 13 regions compared to an expected 15. The two missing regions are of order 2, those that would be formed by the intersection of the two diagonally opposite curves. We can repair this diagram by adding appendages to two of the curves:</p>

                [image]

                <p>This is topologically correct, but it's uglier than the 2-Venn and 3-Venn diagrams. We pose two questions:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Can a 4-Venn diagram be created using circles?</li>
                    <li>Can a 4-Venn diagram possess fourfold rotational symmetry?</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Interestingly, the answer to both these question is "no." Although it satisfies neither of the above properties, there is a nice-looking 4-Venn diagram built using four congruent ellipses and possessing reflectional symmetry (<em>Keep Talking</em> players may recognize this one):</p>

                [image]

                <p>As we can gather, Venn diagrams of order 4 or more don't generalize easily from the 2-Venn and 3-Venn diagrams. In fact, we might wonder if Venn diagrams even exist at all for <em>n</em> &gt; 4. The answer to this question was positively resolved by Venn himself, who introduced a construction involving drawing curves around the borders of other curves. It's visually messy, but shows that Venn diagrams exist for all orders:</p>

                [image]

                <p>These are not the only higher-order Venn diagrams, and the space of higher-order Venn diagrams is rich, and has fascinated the field of combinatorics for decades.</p>

                <p>One of the most studied topics is symmetric Venn diagrams -- <em>n</em>-Venn diagrams with <em>n</em>-fold rotational symemtry. We've mentioned that no 4-Venn diagram can be symmetric, which follows from Henderson's theorem:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Henderson's theorem:</strong> if a symmetric <em>n</em>-Venn diagram exists, then <em>n</em> must be prime.
                </blockquote>

                <p>That brings us to <em>n</em> = 5, which is prime. Grunbaum found the only symmetric 5-Venn diagram in [year].</p>

                [image]

                <p>The case <em>n</em> = 7 was mysterious. Grunbaum again found the first known example.</p>

                [image]

                <p>As more 7-Venn diagrams were found, some special constraints were established to narrow the search:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Simple:</strong> No three curves can intersect at one point.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monotone:</strong> The regions sort themselves into concentric layers by order. Formally, each region of order 1 &lt; k &lt; n is bordered by regions of order k + 1 and k - 1. (The above diagram is not monotone, reader exercise to see why.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Polar symmetric:</strong> The Venn diagram is topologically identical if turned inside out.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>It was shown that there are exactly six "golden 7-Venn diagrams" that satisfy all three of these properties, named Adelaide, Victoria, Massey, Manawatu, Palmerston North, and Hamilton.</p>

                <p>If you are curious about the <em>n</em> = 11 case, Mamakani and Ruskey discovered the first golden 11-Venn diagram, along with over 200,000 more. Unfortunately, these diagrams are less tenable as interactive Web apps, since most of the 2,047 regions are very small.</p>
